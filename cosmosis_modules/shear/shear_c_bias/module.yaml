assumptions:
    - "Simple additive shear bias model: Xi^{ij}_theta -> Xi^{ij}_theta + c_i + c_j"

explanation: |
    Errors in cosmic shear measurement can lead to a additive factor
    scaling the observed shear spectra.

    This module scales the measured Xi_theta to account for that difference,
    assuming model values of the additive factor c, either per bin or for all bins.

    Since the bias can be different in different bins we have, for the general case
    including cross-spectra:

    Xi^{ij}_theta -> Xi^{ij}_theta + c_i + c_j

params:
    c_per_bin: "Boolean; default=T, If T use a separate c for each bin, otherwise a single global one"

inputs:
    wl_number_density:
        nbin: "Integer, number of tomographic bins."
    shear_calibration_parameters:
        c0: "Real; only if c_per_bin=F. The additive bias for all the bins/"
        c_i: "Integer; only if c_per_bin=F; for i=1..nbin. The additive bias for each bin."
    shear_xi:
        bin_i_j: "Real vector; for i and j=1..nbin. Shear xi."

outputs:
    shear_xi:
        bin_i_j: "Real vector; for i and j=1..nbin. Modified shear xi."
